## useState & useEffect task

In this exercise we are going to use the React + Vite option, just like in the local repository. Where we are going to represent three geometric shapes using the most appropriate HTML elements.

- Triangle
- Circle
- Square

We will allow the color and size of each shape to be controlled interactively by the user.

## An alert should be triggered 

When the size of all elements is the same or when the color of all elements is the same.

Initializes elements with different size and color.
